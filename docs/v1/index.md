# JSON Syntax

## DBC UBL Syntax 2.0 Specification

 * ![raw](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/raw.svg)
 * Editor: Steve Capell
 * Contributors: 

This document describes a JSON based syntax and processing model for UBL semantics. It includes

* A simple JSON syntax model for UBL semantics.
* A lossless transformation model between UBL XML and JSON representations.
* A simple JSON processing model based on a RESTful Validation API 

The intent is to provide developers with a much simpler implementation model than the XSD/Schematron/Genericode alternative whilst maintianing interoperability with the UBL XML standard.

This Specification

 * can be applied equally to any UBL document (this invoice is just the first) and so is maintained as a separate specification.
 * exists to support the Digital Business Council [e-Invoicing initiative](https://ausdigital.github.io), and is under active development at [https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-syn](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-syn).


## Introduction

Widespread adoption of the e-invoicing framework depends on the provision of clear, unambiguous and simple specifications that are developer freindly and impose very low implementation costs.  

As shown in the diagram below, the standard UBL XSD/Schemmatron/Genericode processing model imposes significant complexity burdens on implementers.  An alternative REST/JSON microservices model reduces implementation cost and complexity to a near zero minimum.

e-Invoicing implementers can choose whether to consume third party transformation & validation services or whether to build their own microservices based on this specification.
